        ],
     } },
  ...]
})
```
## Client side configuration


For the NextJs start you need to  make the following changes 

1. Install package to your next starter. This just makes it easier, importing all the scripts implicitly
```
yarn add react-razorpay

```
2. Create a button for Razorpay <next-starter>/src/modules/checkout/components/payment-button/razorpay-payment-button.tsx

like below



````
import { Button } from "@medusajs/ui"
import Spinner from "@modules/common/icons/spinner"
import React, { useCallback, useEffect, useState } from "react"
import  {useRazorpay, RazorpayOrderOptions } from "react-razorpay"
import { HttpTypes } from "@medusajs/types"
import { cancelOrder, placeOrder, waitForPaymentCompletion } from "@lib/data/cart"
import { CurrencyCode } from "react-razorpay/dist/constants/currency"
export const RazorpayPaymentButton = ({
  session,
  notReady,
  cart
}: {
  session: HttpTypes.StorePaymentSession
  notReady: boolean
  cart: HttpTypes.StoreCart
}) => {
  const [disabled, setDisabled] = useState(false)
  const [submitting, setSubmitting] = useState(false)
  const [errorMessage, setErrorMessage] = useState<string | undefined>(undefined)
  const {Razorpay
   } = useRazorpay();
  
  const [orderData,setOrderData] = useState({id:""})

  
  console.log(`session_data: `+JSON.stringify(session))
  const onPaymentCompleted = async () => {
    await placeOrder().catch(() => {
      setErrorMessage("An error occurred, please try again.")
      setSubmitting(false)
    })
  }
  useEffect(()=>{
    setOrderData(session.data as {id:string})
  },[session.data])

  


  const handlePayment = useCallback(async() => {
    const onPaymentCancelled = async () => {
      await cancelOrder(session.provider_id).catch(() => {
        setErrorMessage("PaymentCancelled")
        setSubmitting(false)
      })
    }
    const options: RazorpayOrderOptions = {
      callback_url: `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL}/razorpay/hooks`,
      key: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_RAZORPAY_KEY ?? '',
      amount: session.amount*100*100,
      order_id: orderData.id,
      currency: cart.currency_code.toUpperCase() as CurrencyCode,
      name: process.env.COMPANY_NAME ?? "your company name ",
      description: `Order number ${orderData.id}`,
      remember_customer:true,
      

      image: "https://example.com/your_logo",
      modal: {
        backdropclose: true,
        escape: true,
        handleback: true,
        confirm_close: true,
        ondismiss: async () => {
          setSubmitting(false)
          setErrorMessage(`payment cancelled`)
          await onPaymentCancelled()
        },
        animation: true,
      },
      
      handler: async () => {
        onPaymentCompleted()
      },
      "prefill": {
        "name": cart.billing_address?.first_name + " " + cart?.billing_address?.last_name,
        "email": cart?.email,
        "contact": (cart?.shipping_address?.phone) ?? undefined
      },
      
      
    };
    console.log(JSON.stringify(options.amount))
    //await waitForPaymentCompletion();
    
    
    const razorpay = new Razorpay(options);
    if(orderData.id)
    razorpay.open();
    razorpay.on("payment.failed", function (response: any) {
      setErrorMessage(JSON.stringify(response.error))
   
    })
   razorpay.on("payment.authorized" as any, function (response: any) {
    const authorizedCart = placeOrder().then(authorizedCart=>{
    JSON.stringify(`authorized:`+ authorizedCart)
    })
    })
    // razorpay.on("payment.captured", function (response: any) {

    // }
    // )
  }, [Razorpay, cart.billing_address?.first_name, cart.billing_address?.last_name, cart.currency_code, cart?.email, cart?.shipping_address?.phone, orderData.id, session.amount, session.provider_id]);
  console.log("orderData"+JSON.stringify(orderData))
  return (
    <>
      <Button
        disabled={submitting || notReady || !orderData?.id||orderData.id == ''}
        onClick={()=>{
          console.log(`processing order id: ${orderData.id}`)
          handlePayment()}
        }
      >
        {submitting ? <Spinner /> : "Checkout"}
      </Button>
      {errorMessage && (
        <div className="text-red-500 text-small-regular mt-2">
          {errorMessage}
        </div>
      )}
    </>
  )
}
`````

Step 3. 

nextjs-starter-medusa/src/lib/constants.tsx
add

```
export const isRazorpay = (providerId?: string) => {
  return providerId?.startsWith("pp_razorpay")
}

// and the following to the list
export const paymentInfoMap: Record<
  string,
  { title: string; icon: React.JSX.Element }
> = {...
   pp_razorpay_razorpay: {
    title: "Razorpay",
    icon: <CreditCard />,
  },
  ...}

````
step 4.add into the payment element <next-starter>/src/modules/checkout/components/payment-button/index.tsx

first 
```
import import {RazorpayPaymentButton} from "./razorpay-payment-button"
```
then
```
case "razorpay":
         return <RazorpayPaymentButton session={paymentSession} notReady={notReady} cart={cart} />
```


Step 4. modify initiatePaymentSession in the client storefront/src/modules/checkout/components/payment/index.tsx
```

.....
 try {
      const shouldInputCard =
        isStripeFunc(selectedPaymentMethod) && !activeSession

      if (!activeSession) {
        await initiatePaymentSession(cart, {
          provider_id: selectedPaymentMethod,
          context:{
            extra:cart
          }
        })
      }
 }
 ....
```

Step 5. Add environment variables in the client

  NEXT_PUBLIC_RAZORPAY_KEY:<your razorpay key>
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOP_NAME:<your razorpay shop name>
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOP_DESCRIPTION: <your razorpayshop description>
#### watch out
Step 6. Caveat 
the default starter template has an option which says use the same shipping and billing address
please ensure you deselect this and enter the phone number manually in the billing section.

Step 7.

In razorpay create a webhook with the following url 

<your host>/hooks/payment/razorpay_razorpay
